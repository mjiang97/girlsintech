        <h2>The gender gap</h2>
        <p>
          Most people recognize that the lack of women in tech is a real
          problem. We’re not equipping our girls with the tools they need to
          access the highest-paying, fastest-growing jobs in the global economy.
          We are forgoing innovation from girls and women, who have incredible
          ideas and potential for transforming society. We’re leaving our girls,
          communities and entire markets behind. The question, then, is how do
          we bring more girls into this field?

        <h2>Our mission</h2>
        <p>
          The “It’s a man’s world and a man’s job” mindset is injected in most
          female's brains.There are a number of reasons why girls who are
          interested in TECH don’t pursue technology-related degrees. These
          include negative stereotypes, lack of role models, discouragement, low
          self-confidence and fear of competing in a male-dominated industry.
          Somewhere along the way, girls get the message that computer science
          isn’t for them. But this doesn’t mean we can’t change this. We really
          believe that in order to increase the pool of girls in the TECH
          industry, we have to inspire young girls to be excited about it. It
          all should begin in a young girl’s mind. She should feel equal. <br />
          We want to give girls the message that technology jobs are
          interesting, varied and good for them. They can allow a young woman to
          see the world, grow and set herself up for the future in a well-paying
          and flexible environment. We need to show this to girls and keep
          drawing them to tech so we can all benefit.
